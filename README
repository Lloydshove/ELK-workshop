Run through the following from start to finish and you'll have logged items from an app being picked up and thrown into elastic search so you can then graph them in Kibana


Static Html
- - - - - -
Open in intelliJ
Run the run configuration
Static html is now hosted here : 

Head - for viewing elastic search status - http://localhost:8080/head/elasticsearch-head-master/
Kibana - for visualising data - http://localhost:8080/kibana/kibana-3.1.0/


Elastic Search
- - - - - - - -
unzip it
run "bin/elasticsearch"
check it on the 'head' website above 
if you want to run more than one instance check config/elasticsearch.yml and 


Logstash
- - - - - - - -
unzip it
update config/logstash-universe.conf to your install path
whats the config doing?
run logstash pointing it at the config -vvv for very very verbose output
bin/logstash -f ../config/logstash -vvv


TheApp
- - - - 
Run it.  
see the unformatted.log entries
see the logstash verbose output of the stashing of logs
see the elastic search console out put, its created an index!
check the head plugin (see static HTML above).  How much data was inserted?
check Kibana (see static HTML above)


Kibana
- - - - 
*WARNING* save your kibana dashboard regularly.  Refreshing the browser loses it!  Where does the saved dashboard go (hint: check Head) *WARNING*

Graph the data in Kibana however you want.  
How many of each planet/galaxy/solarsystem/universe was there?
What was the average duration each type survived for?
How many things were destroyed by the daleks?

What other log data do you want to add to get better stats?


Extra Credit
- - - - - - -
Play with elastic search.  Run multiple nodes, change the redundancy, shut one down, see it rebalance in Head.
What performance can you get?  
Can you connect elastic search instances from multiple laptops in the workshop?
Change the CosmologicalConstants in the app so logging is more rapid, how can you get better throughput into elastic?Does the logstash config make a difference?
Play with Kibana, run multiple dashboards with different types of searches, play with the different charts.
